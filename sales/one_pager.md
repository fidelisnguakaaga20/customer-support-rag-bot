# WhatsApp Restaurant Customer Support Assistant (No Hallucinations)

## What it does
A local AI tool that helps your staff reply to WhatsApp customers faster — without guessing.
It answers ONLY from your restaurant’s approved info (menu/policies), and refuses politely when info is missing.

## Why restaurants like it
- Faster replies (staff copy-paste customer message → get ready reply)
- No wrong promises (no fake prices, no fake delivery zones, no invented menu)
- Consistent tone + less stress for staff

## What it can answer safely
- Menu (only listed items)
- Opening hours
- Delivery rules (Abuja only)
- Payment policy (no cash on delivery)
- Cancellation policy
- Special diet requests (manual confirmation)
- Stock/availability (manual confirmation)

## What it will NEVER do
- Guess prices
- Invent menu items
- Promise availability
- Claim delivery outside Abuja

## How it works (Hybrid Mode)
1) Customer messages you on WhatsApp  
2) Staff copies the message  
3) Paste into the AI tool  
4) Copy the AI reply  
5) Paste back into WhatsApp  

No automation. Human stays in control.

## Delivery time
Setup in 24–48 hours after you share your menu & policies.

## What you get
- Your menu/policies converted into a safe knowledge base
- Local AI tool + quick training for staff
- Proof screenshots of correct/refusal behavior
- 1 week support after setup
